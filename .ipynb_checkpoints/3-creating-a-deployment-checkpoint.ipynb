    "Now so far we have learned about pods in Kubernetes.  In Kubernetes, pods are the fundamental unit that we work with to organize our application.  But, as we'll see, we normally do not create pods directly. Instead we'll create a pod through a deployment.  With a deployment, we'll begin to see some of the benefits of using kubernetes.  As we'll see, with deployments, we can create multiple replicas of the same pod, update these replicas, and get automatic rollbacks if there is an error.  Ok, let's get to it."
